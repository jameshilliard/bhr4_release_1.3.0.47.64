<div class="paragraph"><p>Through this section you will be able to launch and stop the web
server. It also provides some useful information about the server and
the configuration status, as well as some hardware stats. Also, the
lower right corner of the screen will allow you to shut-down
Cherokee-Admin without leaving the web interface, which might be
convenient particularly if you have launched it using
<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin-launcher.html">cherokee-admin-launcher</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This section also enables you to change Cherokee-Admin&#8217;s current user

<div class="paragraph"><p>From here you will have access to support links, and communication

<div class="paragraph"><p>Besides all that has been mentioned already, the <tt>Remote Services</tt>
section will bring you a completely new range of possibilities.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This checkbox can be disabled for those who do not wish to interact at
all with the outside World. Just leave it unchecked, and
Cherokee-Admin will offer more or less the same capabilitites that it
had to offer before the <a href="config_market.html">Cherokee Market</a>
era. However, when this option is checked, the new
<a href="config_market.html">Market</a> section will appear in the graphical
interface, and the free <tt>Backup Service</tt> will be at your disposal.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Read more about <a href="config_market.html">Cherokee Market</a> to learn
about its full potential. You can join the Market by creating a free
account using the link provided for that purpose.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To take advantage of the <tt>Backup Service</tt>, you will need a Cherokee
Market account, and will have to be logged in.</p></div>
<h4 id="_backup_service">Backup Service</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once you are logged in, you will be able to remotely backup and
restore your configuration, so that it is accessible from wherever you
need it, whenever you need it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can associate description notes to each saved configuration, and
it will be stored along the date of creation so that you can easily
retrieve it in the future.</p></div>
